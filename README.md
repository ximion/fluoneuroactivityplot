# GCaMP-3 fluorescence recording neuron activity analyzer & plotter

This is a tiny script I developed for a single project where the neural activity
in nerves had to be compared.
The recordings were done on preparated nerves of Drosphila larvae, with the mouth-hooks
of the larva being in a different liquid than the preparated brain.
Due to the nature of this setup, the specimen drifted quite a bit, in- or decreasing its
brighness.

The script tries to account for drifting, and extracts events as well as calculating a nerve
activity score.

The script might not be self explanatory (but it's simple!), but someone might find it useful anyway.
If you have questions, feel free to file an issue and ask.
